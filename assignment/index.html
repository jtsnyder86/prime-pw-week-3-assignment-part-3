        <li>When I created the code for Q. 2a, it caused issues with my code for 3a. The code is as follows:
          2a. for(stars of stars){
            console.log( stars );
          };
          3a. let i = 0
          console.log('Some stars using while:')
          while (stars [i]) {
            console.log(stars[i]);
            i++;
          };
          We eventually worked it out, but I am wondering what was it about these two blocks of code that caused my issue.
        </li>
        <li>This is regarding something that wasn't necessarily discussed in any of the lessons - what does this do exactly " `Text ${referenced code/variable/array} text' ";
          I saw it in unit two I think, and used it this unit and unit 2.  It works for what I needed it to do, but I just don't know exactly what it is doing or used for.
        </li>
        <li>My last question is about the terminal: I started getting a return in terminal, dquote>, and I don't know why it started showing up.  I know how to get it to go away if comes back,
          but I don't know why it started showing up.
        </li>
