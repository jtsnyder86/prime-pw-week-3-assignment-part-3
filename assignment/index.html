        <li>When I created the code for Q. 2a, it caused issues with my code for 3a. The code is as follows:
          2a. for(stars of stars){
            console.log( stars );
          };
          3a. let i = 0
          console.log('Some stars using while:')
          while (stars [i]) {
            console.log(stars[i]);
            i++;
          };
          We eventually worked it out, but I am wondering what was it about these two blocks of code that caused my issue.
